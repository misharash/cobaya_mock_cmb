# Here, CMB S4 is modelled as in the science book (1907.04473) with only one effective channel (adapted to MP by JBM and then to Cobaya by MR)

# where to read/write fiducial model:

data_directory: null
fiducial_file: mock_CMBS4_fiducial.dat

# experimental sensitivity:
# perhaps lmax=3000 for T modes due to foregrounds, to 1907.04473 uses lmax=5000

l_min: 30
l_max: 5000
f_sky: 0.6
num_channels: 1

# angular resolution
# theta_fwhm must be in in arcmin

theta_fwhm: [1.4]

# resolution for Temperature and Polarization sigmas must be in muK.arcmin
# Page iv in 1907.04473: "noise level of 1 ÂµK-arcmin (...) over 60% of the sky""

sigma_T: [1.00]
sigma_P: [1.41]
