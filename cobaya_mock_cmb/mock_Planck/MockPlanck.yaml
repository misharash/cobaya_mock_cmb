# Here, Planck is modelled as in (1611.05883), with two effective channels (adapted to Cobaya by MR)

# where to read/write fiducial model:

data_directory: null
fiducial_file: mock_Planck_fiducial.dat

# experimental sensitivity:
# l_min=30 and f_sky=0.2 to add to mock likelihoods for future experiments.

l_min: 30
l_max: 2500
f_sky: 0.2
num_channels: 2

# angular resolution
# theta_fwhm must be in in arcmin

theta_fwhm: [7, 5]

# resolution for Temperature and Polarization, sigmas must be in muK.arcmin
# Follow sec III.A in 1611.05883

sigma_T: [43, 66]
sigma_P: [81, 134]
