# Here, Simons Observatory (SO) is modelled as in (2007.04325, LAT), with only one effective channel (adapted to MP by JBM and then to Cobaya by MR)

# where to read/write fiducial model:

data_directory: null
fiducial_file: mock_SO_fiducial.dat

# experimental sensitivity:
# we stop at lmax=3000 to avoid foregrounds in T, and since noise overcomes E mode by then (1808.07445 Fig 5)

l_min: 30
l_max: 3000
f_sky: 0.4
num_channels: 1

# angular resolution
# theta_fwhm must be in in arcmin

theta_fwhm: [1.4]

# resolution for Temperature and Polarization, sigmas must be in muK.arcmin
# Follow sec IV.C in 2007.04325

sigma_T: [6.00]
