# Here, Simons Observatory (SO) is modelled with TT, EE deproj0 noise curves from https://simonsobservatory.org/assets/supplements/20180822_SO_Noise_Public.tgz (baseline sensitivity)
# but with non-LCDM fiducial, namely with small-scale baryon clumping

# where to read/write fiducial model:

data_directory: null
fiducial_file: mock_SO_clumping_fiducial.dat

# noise from file

noise_from_file: True
noise_file: ../mock_SO_baseline/SO_LAT_Nell_T_E_baseline_fsky0p4_ILC_CMB.txt

# noise file provides data from ell = 10 to 5000

l_min: 10
l_max: 5000
f_sky: 0.4
